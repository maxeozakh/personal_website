        <h3>December Adventure, what is it?</h3>
        <p>
          And if you can believe it..it's an
          <a href="https://eli.li/december-adventure">ADVENTURE! ✶</a> in the
          domain of coding. The idea is to write some code every day during the
          upcoming month. Low key, just a little..
        </p>
        <p>
          My thing will be learning about machines like Turing or Boltzmann ones
          (not sure that I'll be able to grasp the second one though), and
          prototyping my interpretations of how they work via code snippets.
          Probably in Python, to keep things simple?

        <h3>Day 4 - Interpreter World</h3>
        <p>
          Thought about an interpreter a little. Basically, to migrate a Regular
          Turing machine to Universal one, I need to only move instructions from
          the Machine to the tape level, and write some kind of parser for those
          instructions, like: "this is the separator between different
          instructions, this is how to deconstruct an instruction into its
          logical parts like <code>action</code>, <code>next_state</code>, etc."
          Would I like to implement it?
        </p>
        <pre>
<code>
def interpreter(data):
  [instuction, value1, value2] = data
  if instuction == 'СЛОЖИ':
    return value1 + value2

  return 'cant interpret it'

interpreter(['СЛОЖИ', 2, 2]) # 5

          It doesn't do anything fancy, and it's not even binary-encoded. It
          just does stuff (erases the first symbol and writes "flower" into the
          tape) if tape starts with 1, and does nothing if it starts from 0.
          Super simple, but it encapsulates(?) the whole concept of Turing
          Machine. Key components:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Tape</b> - in the physical representation of a Turing Machine,
            the tape is divided into cells, each capable of holding a symbol. We
            have an array instead
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Tape head</b> aka <b>awareness</b> - a head that moves along the
            tape and reads symbols. In our case it's just an index pointer
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Set of states</b> - the machine can be in one of a finite number
            of states, including a special "HALT" aka termination state. Here we
            have 0 - initial state, 1 for main "flower" logic, 2 for example of
            branching, and "HALT" to stop the thing
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Transition Function</b> aka <b>instuctions </b> - conceptually
            it's a table with conditions <code>IF</code>, actions
            <code>ACTION</code> and the next state <code>STATE</code>. In my
            code snippet we have <code>cond</code>, <code>do</code> and
            <code>next_state</code>. It's a bit odd that
            <code>ACTION/do</code> combines both writing/erasing and moving, but
            who cares<br />

        <h3>Day 1 - Intro to Turing machines</h3>
        <p>You step onto the road, keep your feet.</p>
        <p>
          There are two types of Turing machines, "Regular" and "Universal". At
          first I thought about them as "just a function" and "high-order
          function which executes other functions". Well, not exactly right on
          an abstraction level. A closer analogy would be "hardcoded function"
          vs "programming language interpreter".
        </p>
        <p>
          The main difference between these two machines is that "Regular" one
          contains instructions for a specific task AND those instructions are
          considered as part of the machine itself. "Universal" one does not
          contain instructions for a specific task, it reads them from the data
          itself.

def regular(data):
    # Fixed set of instructions (part of the machine itself)
    instructions = {"reverse": lambda x: x[::-1]}

def universal(data):
    for thing in data:
        [instruction, variable] = thing

          "Universal" is a chef in a restaurant (any recipe - any dish),
          "Regular" is a person who is trained to do french fries only (one
